/*
48. Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]

Constraints:
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

    APPROACH: 
    Rotation Logic
    Each element in the matrix moves as if it is being rotated around the center by 90°clockwise.

    For a given position (i,j), its rotated positions are:

    0°→(i,j)
    90°→(j,n−1−i)
    180°→(n−1−i,n−1−j)
    270°→(n−1−j,i)
    These four positions form a cycle.

    Time Complexity: O(n^2) - We need to visit each element of the matrix once to perform the rotation.
    Space Complexity: O(1) - We are rotating the matrix in place, so we
