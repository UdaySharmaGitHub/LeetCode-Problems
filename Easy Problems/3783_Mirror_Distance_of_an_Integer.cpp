/*
3783. Mirror Distance of an Integer
You are given an integer n.
Define its mirror distance as: abs(n - reverse(n))​​​​​​​ where reverse(n) is the integer formed by reversing the digits of n.
Return an integer denoting the mirror distance of n​​​​​​​.
abs(x) denotes the absolute value of x.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 25
Output: 27
Explanation:
reverse(25) = 52.
Thus, the answer is abs(25 - 52) = 27.
Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 9
Explanation:
reverse(10) = 01 which is 1.
Thus, the answer is abs(10 - 1) = 9.
Example 3:
Input: n = 7
Output: 0
Explanation:
reverse(7) = 7.
Thus, the answer is abs(7 - 7) = 0.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109
